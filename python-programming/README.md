This is the repository for the Introduction to Python workshop at GW Libraries.

# 1. Set up Anaconda

Install Python 3 using Anaconda as described at http://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/#python

# 2. Start Juypter Notebook

* Open the Anaconda Navigator desktop app (it has a green circle icon)
* In Anaconda Navigator, launch Jupyter Notebook.  This will open in a web browser tab.

# 3. Download the files for this workshop 

* Using the "New" button in the upper right, start a new Python notebook.  This will open in a new browser tab.
* In the notebook, type (or copy & paste from here):

`!git clone https://github.com/gwu-libraries/gwlibraries-workshops.git`

and press **Shift-Return** (or **Shift-Enter**) to run the cell.

The result should look similar to:
```

```

* Close the notebook: In the File menu, select "Close and Halt"

# 4. Open the notebook for this workshop

* In the Home tab for Jupyter, you should now see a folder called `gwlibraries-workshops`.  Click into this folder, then click into the `python-programming` folder.
* Click on `Python Workshop.ipynb` to open it.
