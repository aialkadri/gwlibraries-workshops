The workshop materials are in the form of iPython notebooks.  Provided here are two alternatives for running the notebooks:

   For importing into Google Colab from Github:  Search on: `gwu-libraries/gwlibraries-workshops`
   
   And a handy link for ways to import/export files in Google Colaboratory:  https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/io.ipynb
