# RStudio + Git for Collaboration and Reproducibility

## Setup instructions

You can skip the R and RStudio instructions if you already have these installed.  It would, however, be a good idea to bring your versions of both R and RStudio up to date.

***Attendees of the Nov. 2019 workshop at GWSPH:*** If you encounter any problems with these installations prior to the workshop, please contact me at kerchner@gwu.edu and I can drop by to assist.

### Install R
